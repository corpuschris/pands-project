## Programming and Scripting - Fisherâ€™s Iris Dataset
***
This project focuses on accessing and analyzing the [Iris](https://github.com/corpuschris/pands-project/blob/master/iris.csv) dataset, a classic dataset frequently used in data science and machine learning.[1] By working with this dataset, we aim to showcase a range of skills, including data manipulation, statistical analysis, visualization, and programming techniques using [Python](https://www.python.org/) within the Jupyter Notebook environment.[2]

### About this project:
***

This project involves the [Iris](https://github.com/corpuschris/pands-project/blob/master/iris.csv) dataset.

### Getting Started:
***

I used [openincolab](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link. It opens the [`analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/corpuschris/pands-project/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
